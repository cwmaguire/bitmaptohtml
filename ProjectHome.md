BitmapToHTML converts bitmaps to HTML tables and uses simple compression and an inline CSS stylesheet to reduce the size of the HTML table.

Having a bitmap in an HTML table gives two benefits:
  * All images and text can be included in one file
  * An inline CSS Stylesheet allows colours to be changed easily
